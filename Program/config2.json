Surgery to stop stomach acid leaking into your oesophagus may be recommended if medication isn't helping, or you don't want to take medication on a long-term basis.",

    "Hypothyroidism":"Eat a balanced diet\nYour thyroid needs adequate amounts of iodine in order to fully function. You don’t need to take an iodine supplement in order for that to happen. A balanced diet of whole grains, beans, lean proteins, and colorful fruits and vegetables should provide enough iodine.\n\nMonitor soy intake\nSoy may hinder the absorption of thyroid hormones. If you drink or eat too many soy products, you may not be able to properly absorb your medication. This can be especially important in infants needing treatment for hypothyroidism who also drink soy formula.\n\nSoy is found in:\n\ntofu\nvegan cheese and meat products\nsoy milk\nsoybeans\nsoy sauce\nYou need steady doses of the medication to achieve even levels of thyroid hormone in your blood. Avoid eating or drinking soy-based foods for at least two hours before and after you take your medication.\n\nBe smart with fiber\nLike soy, fiber may interfere with hormone absorption. Too much dietary fiber may prevent your body from getting the hormones it needs. Fiber is important, so don’t avoid it entirely. Instead, avoid taking your medicine within several hours of eating high-fiber foods.\n\nDon’t take thyroid medicine with other supplements\nIf you take supplements or medications in addition to thyroid medicine, try to take these medicines at different times. Other medications can interfere with absorption, so it’s best to take your thyroid medicine on an empty stomach and without other medicines or foods.",

    "Peptic ulcer diseae":"You may reduce your risk of peptic ulcer if you follow the same strategies recommended as home remedies to treat ulcers. It also may be helpful to:\n\nProtect yourself from infections.

For instance, take your medication with meals.\n\nWork with your doctor to find the lowest dose possible that still gives you pain relief. Avoid drinking alcohol when taking your medication, since the two can combine to increase your risk of stomach upset.\n\nIf you need an NSAID, you may need to also take additional medications such as an antacid, a proton pump inhibitor, an acid blocker or cytoprotective agent. A class of NSAIDs called COX-2 inhibitors may be less likely to cause peptic ulcers, but may increase the risk of heart attack.",
